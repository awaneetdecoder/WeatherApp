## üì∏ Showcase

The most important part is showing your app in action. The best way to do this is with a GIF. You can use a free tool like [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) (for Windows) or Giphy Capture (for Mac) to record your app.

*Record a short clip of you searching for a city and toggling the theme.*
